# Hi, I'm Austin Brown

I have two degrees Electrical and Computer Engineering from **West Virginia University**, graduated in **May 2025**. I'm passionate about **embedded systems**, **robotics**, and building real-time software that interacts with the physical world.

## About Me

-  I enjoy designing and programming on microcontrollers (STM32, ESP32) and single-board computers (Jetson, Raspberry Pi).
-  I interested in **Embedded Systems**, **real-time operating systems**, **real-time operating systems**, and **Controls**.
-  My toolbox includes: `C`, `MATLAB`, `Python`, `Assembly`, `FreeRTOS`, `ROS2`, `Simulink`, and KiCad.
-  I cycled over **4,300 miles** across the U.S. raising funds for disability awareness with The Ability Experience.

## Notable Projects

### Multitasking Operating System (x86)
- Wrote a modular OS in C and Assembly with custom memory management and process control.
- Implemented multitasking using priority-based scheduling and context switching via ISRs.

### F1TENTH Autonomous Racing Platform
- Developed real-time control and path-planning algorithms on an NVIDIA Jetson.
- Tuned sensor integration and motor control to optimize performance during competition.

### Differential Drive Robot (Mobile Robotics)
- Designed and tuned an Extended Kalman Filter for accurate pose estimation using sensor fusion.
- Programmed PID controllers to navigate through uncertainty in a competitive setting.
